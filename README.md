A custom server for Super Mario Bros. 35 running inside a Docker container

# Big thanks to:
* [kinnay/SMB35](https://github.com/kinnay/SMB35)  - The original implementation for the custom server
 * [SMB35 Continued Interest Community](https://smb35server.com/) - Some folks still playing on and running a centralized custom server

# Instructions:

# Still to do:
  * Generate IPS patch to redirect game to custom server address
